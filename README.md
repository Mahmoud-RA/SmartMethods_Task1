The Control.html will take the values and once the user click on save it will save the values without exiting the page and keep the state to be off.

Once the user pick the new values and click on run it will save the new values and change the state to be ON insted of being OFF.

after that it will go to values.php to show the running values.

once the user pick the values and click on run
it will go to values.php and show the direction and values to the user
